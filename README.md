### This project aims to analyze trends and patterns in stock market data, focusing on the relationships between technical indicators and market performance. The dataset is obtained in CSV format through a custom scraping process implemented in the ```data_scraping.ipynb``` notebook, which retrieves stock market data enriched with technical indicators using the [AlphaVantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/), a reliable source of financial data. By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques with tools such as HoloViews, hvPlot, and Plotly, the project will create interactive and dynamic dashboards to explore data relationships. These visualizations will include time series analysis, correlation heatmaps, and comparative performance analyses, helping to identify key patterns, such as the influence of specific indicators on stock trends. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear and engaging insights into stock market trends, using interactive visualizations to simplify the analysis of technical indicators and their impact on market performance.
